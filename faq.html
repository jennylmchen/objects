                    <p>Final project for ARC 682 Assemble Again at Syracuse University. 
                        We studied a piece of material all semester and investigated ways to document, deconstruct, then reassemble it. 
                        My starting material is the PVC coupling.

                    <p>I collected plastic domestic objects and filled the interstitial space between each pair, 
                        highlighting the reusability (or lack thereof) of these objects that are easily neglected and discarded.
                        These cups and containers were once filled with organic or ingestible material that partake
                        in the nature cycle of consumption. instead, they are now filled with silicon mold maker,
                        a one way process that does not break down, much like the containers themselves.

                        Somewhere down the road these noncyclical objects begin to pile up and eventually overflows, 
                        burying everything in its way.
